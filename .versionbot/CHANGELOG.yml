    - subject: Ignore reviews by deployment creators, not specifically authors
      hash: 2b1fa79d40e80c5fd51923e3dfa1e990da1ded4b
      body: |
        Getting a list of commit authors is an async operation that
        leaves a small window for a time-of-use attack.

        Prefer to use data from the initial event context where possible
        and avoid extra async calls to the GitHub API.
